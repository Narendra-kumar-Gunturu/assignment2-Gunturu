“Never stop learning, because life never stops teaching”.
This is the quote, which inspired the most and helped me build
myself with confidence and higher objectives for my future. I believe in
this notion, that life is a never ending teacher and it keeps teaching you
until your last breath, only thing is, the more you ask, the more you learn.
In the past century, there is a persistent technology growth in newer
dimensions related to computers which we never thought it would exist.
